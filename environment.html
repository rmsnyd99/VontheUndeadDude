	<p>Though he cannot remember his life before death, Von was once a young Spanish conquistador named Emmanuel Serrano. In the year 1654, while exploring a cove on the beaches of Puerto Rico with his regiment, he fell into a hidden ravine with another soldier, a young idealist by the name of Frederick. After two weeks trapped in the ravine with no food or water, Emmanuel killed and ate his subordinate out of desperation, only to be buried alive in a cave-in shortly after. Hundreds of years passed, and he was discovered by a group of marine biologists deep-sea diving off the coast. After his body was broken free from the chunk of sediment encasing it, the scientists found to their horror that Serrano was somehow still alive, comatose. Little did they know that the ghost of the boy he’d eaten, Frederick, was inhabiting Emmanuel’s body. After awakening, Von- with no knowledge of who he was and incapable of much coherent thought besides basic motor functions- wants very much to be freed of the ghost within him so he can die already, but Frederick, out of revenge, is unwilling to let him. <p>
